# Vue CDN User Info App

## Project Description

This project is a basic Vue CDN app that demonstrates Vue CDN functionality by showcasing user information. When the "Get Profile Data" button is clicked, the app fetches random user data from an API and updates the display accordingly. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app in action.
